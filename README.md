# Game_of_Life

This is my attempt at creating Conway's Game of Life. Visualizing under-population and over-population with text outputting to the console and running in iterations until the user tells it to stop. The simple rules are:
If a cell is dead (0) and has exactly three neighbors, make it alive (1)
If a cell is alive and has less than 2 neighbors, or more than 3 neighbors, then make it dead.
Each cell's neighbors are the ones next to it and diagonal form them
